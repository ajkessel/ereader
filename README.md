Eread-it-later is an open source client application for read it later services. Currently this is limited to Instapaper. Eread-it-later is based on KOReader, so it works with Kobo/Kindle/etc.

Eread-it-later is currently in early development and has only been tested on Kobo so far. It's still very much a work in progress. It probably needs a better name at some point, too.

## How to Install

Download the current [release](https://github.com/quicklywilliam/ereaditlater/releases) and install using the "Manual Installation Method" detailed [here](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/Installation-on-Kobo-devices#manual-installation-method-based-on-kfmon). Note that it is not yet possible to run this project alongside KOReader â€“ installing will replace your current KOReader install, if any.

## Setting up for development

In order to run the app in the emulator, you will need to your own OAUTH client keys. You can obtain these credentials by [applying for Instapaper API access](https://www.instapaper.com/api).

Once you have them, create a `secrets.txt` file in ~/.config/koreader with your Instapaper API credentials:

```
instapaper_ouath_consumer_key = "your_consumer_key"
instapaper_oauth_consumer_secret = "your_consumer_secret"
```

After this, follow the [typical steps](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/master/doc/Building.md) for building and running koreader.
